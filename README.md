# CS330OpenGL
 
     
    This repository contains my files for CS330(Computer Graphics and Visualization). Through this course I gained a stronger understanding of how lighting, textures, and shading techniques work. 
    Understanding how to iterate on visual designs was a new skill for me. To better iterate, I started by blocking out my design. I wasn't concerned with making the shapes perfect. 
    Instead, I found a rough position for each and refined it from there. Doing this helped me focus on the layout before spending too much time on details. During each milestone, I applied techniques from the assignment to my final project. 
    This helped me build upon my scene by adding lighting, textures, and more. One of my next classes is on Full Stack Development and involves building a website. 
    I want to apply what I learned here to using WebGL and make engaging webpages. Understanding WebGL will be a useful skill when working as a web designer.
